What is the benefit of being in cash during a correction,"Being in cash during a correction can give you a position of power â€“ you can pick and choose the right moments to re-enter the market when the risk-reward ratio is in your favor. Use your time in cash to research and plan your next moves, so youâ€™re ready to act when the opportunity presents itself.

The benefits of being in cash during a stock market correction include the following:
