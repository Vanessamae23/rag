      "Question": "What is Web Eraser",
      "Uncleaned": "Web Eraser was planned to be a feature in Apple's Safari browser which would allow users to delete or hide certain elements of a webpage like images or advertisements etc., essentially acting as an in-built content-blocker. However, it's important to note that according to Apple; this feature is not intended to function as an adblocker.",
      "Cleaned": "Web Eraser is a feature that was proposed by Apple for its Safari browser  . This feature would allow users to hide individual components on a webpage, including what Apple refers to as \"distracting parts\" of a website. In theory, this could also be used to hide ads, but Apple has clarified that it is not an adblocker. If an ad overlaps with text or a button on the page, you can use Web Eraser to hide it. However, this only works temporarily; upon reloading the page, the ad will be visible again. The introduction of this feature led to concerns among advertisers and publishers who feared that consumers would use it to avoid advertising. As such, despite being leaked earlier in 2024 and causing considerable controversy among publishers and advertisers, the Web Eraser feature did not appear in beta versions of iOS and macOS released later that year. It's worth noting that while the concept was initially called \"Web Eraser\", Apple seems to have toned down its approach and stopped using this name following feedback from various stakeholders.",
      "Answer": "'Web Eraser,' as the feature is called, allows users to selectively exclude blocks of information from a Web site. The iPhone owner no longer gets to see those blocks until he unblocks them."
